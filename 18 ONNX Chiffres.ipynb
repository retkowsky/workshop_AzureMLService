    "# Handwritten Digit Classification (MNIST) using ONNX Runtime on Azure ML\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to deploy an image classification neural network using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) dataset and Open Neural Network eXchange format ([ONNX](http://aka.ms/onnxdocarticle)) on the Azure Machine Learning platform. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. This tutorial will show you how to deploy a MNIST model from the [ONNX model zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models), use it to make predictions using ONNX Runtime Inference, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will be referring to ONNX, a neural network exchange format used to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools (CNTK, PyTorch, Caffe, MXNet, TensorFlow) and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners including Microsoft AI, Facebook, and Amazon. For more information, explore the [ONNX website](http://onnx.ai) and [open source files](https://github.com/onnx).\n",
    "\n",
    "[ONNX Runtime](https://aka.ms/onnxruntime-python) is the runtime engine that enables evaluation of trained machine learning (Traditional ML and Deep Learning) models with high performance and low resource utilization.\n",

    "#### Tutorial Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the MNIST dataset and pretrained Convolutional Neural Net ONNX model, stored in the ONNX model zoo.\n",
    "- Deploy and run the pretrained MNIST ONNX model on an Azure Machine Learning instance\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install Azure ML SDK and create a new workspace\n",
    "Please follow [Azure ML configuration notebook](../../../configuration.ipynb) to set up your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install additional packages needed for this tutorial notebook\n",
    "You need to install the popular plotting library `matplotlib`, the image manipulation library `opencv`, and the `onnx` library in the conda environment where Azure Maching Learning SDK is installed. \n",

    "```sh\n",
    "(myenv) $ pip install matplotlib onnx opencv-python\n",

    "**Debugging tip**: Make sure that you run the \"jupyter notebook\" command to launch this notebook after activating your virtual environment. Choose the respective Python kernel for your new virtual environment using the `Kernel > Change Kernel` menu above. If you have completed the steps correctly, the upper right corner of your screen should state `Python [conda env:myenv]` instead of `Python [default]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Download sample data and pre-trained ONNX model from ONNX Model Zoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following lines of code, we download [the trained ONNX MNIST model and corresponding test data](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/mnist) and place them in the same folder as this tutorial notebook.

    "#### A brief explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. The CNNs take advantage of the spatial nature of the data. In nature, we perceive different objects by their shapes, size and colors. For example, objects in a natural scene are typically edges, corners/vertices (defined by two of more edges), color patches etc. These primitives are often identified using different detectors (e.g., edge detection, color detector) or combination of detectors interacting to facilitate image interpretation (object classification, region of interest detection, scene description etc.) in real world vision related tasks. These detectors are also known as filters. Convolution is a mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (representing say edges, corners, or colors in the input image).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, these filters are a set of weights that were often hand crafted or modeled with mathematical functions (e.g., [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) / [Laplacian](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm) / [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filter).  The filter outputs are mapped through non-linear activation functions mimicking human brain cells called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron). Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolution Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolution layer is a set of filters. Each filter is defined by a weight (**W**) matrix, and  bias ($b$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.cntk.ai/jup/cntk103d_filterset_v2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These filters are scanned across the image performing the dot product between the weights and corresponding input value ($x$). The bias value is added to the output of the dot product and the resulting sum is optionally mapped through an activation function. This process is illustrated in the following animation."
